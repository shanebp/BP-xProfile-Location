Creates an xProfile Location field type that use the Google Places API to populate and validate the address fields.
The result will be *uniform* and *searchable* addresses with a *single* input field.

You can create multiple Location fields via *wp-admin > Users > Profile Fields > Add New Field*

The xprofile field for each member will be populated as a searchable string.

A latitude / longitude 'geocode' will be saved as a separate field, if that option was selected when the field was created.
